# Ownership-Based System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully removed the role-based system (admin/moderator/user) and implemented an ownership-based system where users who create contests automatically become their owners.

## Key Changes

### Backend Changes

#### 1. User Model (`backend/models/User.js`)
- ✅ Removed `role` field from user schema
- ✅ Removed role-based index
- ✅ All users are now equal - no role hierarchy

#### 2. Contest Model (`backend/models/Contest.js`)
- ✅ Added `ownerId` field (required, references User model)
- ✅ Users who create contests are automatically set as owners

#### 3. Auth Controller (`backend/controllers/authController.js`)
- ✅ Removed role parameter from registration
- ✅ Removed `createAdmin` function
- ✅ Simplified user creation - all users are standard
- ✅ Updated response objects to exclude role information

#### 4. Auth Middleware (`backend/middleware/auth.js`)
- ✅ Removed `authorize` middleware (role-based access control)
- ✅ Added `isContestOwner` middleware to verify contest ownership
- ✅ Only contest owners can modify their contests

#### 5. Contest Controller (`backend/controllers/contestController.js`)
- ✅ Automatically assigns `ownerId` when creating contests
- ✅ Ownership verification handled by middleware
- ✅ Only owners can update, delete, select winners, and view analytics

#### 6. Routes
- **Auth Routes** (`backend/routes/authRoutes.js`)
  - ✅ Removed `create-admin` route
  - ✅ Removed role-based authorization

- **Contest Routes** (`backend/routes/contestRoutes.js`)
  - ✅ Replaced `authorize('admin')` with `isContestOwner`
  - ✅ Anyone can create contests
  - ✅ Only owners can manage their contests

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Config (`frontend/js/config.js`)
- ✅ Removed `CREATE_ADMIN` endpoint

#### 2. Login (`frontend/js/login.js`)
- ✅ Removed role-based redirects
- ✅ All users redirect to dashboard after login
- ✅ Updated alert messages

#### 3. Register (`frontend/js/register.js`)
- ✅ Removed role selection
- ✅ Removed role field from form submission
- ✅ Simplified registration flow

#### 4. Register HTML (`frontend/register.html`)
- ✅ Removed "Account Type" dropdown (role selection)

#### 5. Auth Guard (`frontend/js/auth-guard.js`)
- ✅ Removed `hasRole`, `requireAdmin`, `requireModeratorOrAdmin` functions
- ✅ Kept only `requireAuth` for basic authentication
- ✅ Removed role-based UI logic
- ✅ Simplified user info display (no role badge)

### Database Seeding

#### Seed Script (`seed.js`)
- ✅ Creates a sample user account
- ✅ Assigns sample user as owner of all seeded contests
- ✅ Credentials: `user@example.com` / `password123`

## How It Works Now

### User Registration
1. User registers with name, email, and password
2. No role selection needed - everyone is a standard user
3. User can immediately start creating contests

### Contest Creation
1. Authenticated user creates a contest
2. System automatically assigns the user's ID as `ownerId`
3. User becomes the owner of that contest

### Contest Management
1. Only the contest owner can:
   - Update contest details
   - Delete the contest
   - Select winners
   - View analytics
2. Everyone can:
   - View all contests
   - View individual contest details
   - Register as participants (separate from contest ownership)

### Access Control
- **Authentication**: Required for creating and managing contests
- **Authorization**: Based on ownership, not roles
- **Verification**: Middleware checks if `req.user.id` matches `contest.ownerId`

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `GET /api/contests` - View all contests
- `GET /api/contests/:id` - View contest details

### Protected Endpoints (Authentication Required)
- `POST /api/contests` - Create contest (auto-assigns ownership)
- `PUT /api/contests/:id` - Update contest (owner only)
- `DELETE /api/contests/:id` - Delete contest (owner only)
- `POST /api/contests/:id/select-winners` - Select winners (owner only)
- `GET /api/contests/:id/analytics` - View analytics (owner only)

## Testing

### Sample Credentials
- Email: `user@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Steps to Test
1. Run seed script: `node seed.js`
2. Start server: `npm start`
3. Register a new user or login with sample credentials
4. Create a contest - you become the owner
5. Try to edit/delete contests you own ✅
6. Try to edit/delete contests owned by others ❌ (should be denied)

## Benefits

1. **Simpler System**: No complex role hierarchy to manage
2. **Natural Ownership**: Users automatically own what they create
3. **Better UX**: No confusion about admin panels or special privileges
4. **Scalable**: Each user can create and manage their own contests
5. **Secure**: Ownership verification prevents unauthorized access

## Migration Notes

If you have existing data:
1. All contests need an `ownerId`
2. You can assign existing contests to a default user
3. Remove `role` field from existing users (will be ignored)
4. Update any custom frontend code referencing roles
